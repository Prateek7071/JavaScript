// int is 2^53 
// there is also bigint type which is used for large numbers which is used by appending n at the end of number.
// string  write in ""
// boolean true or false
// null is a standalone value which represents the absence of an object value, but it is defined 
// undefined is a type itself, it means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
// symbol is used for unique identifiers for objects

// ^^ these are premitive datatypes

// object 

console.log(typeof undefined); // is undefined
//but 
console.log(typeof null); // is object and not a type (interview question)
